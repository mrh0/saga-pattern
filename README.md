# saga-pattern

# Install
To install the node dependencies run: ```npm install```

# Test
Running ```npm test``` will execute 11 mocha tests.

# Implementing
Import the saga class from the saga.js file ```const Saga = require('saga-pattern')```.

Saga class public interface:

```constructor(options: { preventFailedBegining: boolean, simulateFailure: {name: boolean}, debugging: boolean, reportFailedRepair: boolean })``` Creates a Saga instance.

```saga.begin(options: {name: string}): SagaStep``` will create a new instance of SagaStep and bind it to this Saga transaction. Every step should represent a atomic mutation in the transaction. Begin can be passed an optional argument object which can be used to set a custom name to the step.

```saga.onFinallyFailed(callback: function): void``` will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when the Saga transaction has completed but one or more steps failed.

```saga.onFinallySucceeded(callback: function): void``` will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when the Saga transaction has completed and all steps where successful.

```saga.onStepFailed(callback: function): void``` will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when any step fail.

```saga.onStepSucceeded(callback: function): void``` will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when any step is completed and successful.

Any callback event listeners should be registred with the four above functions before calling begin().

```saga.hasFailed(): boolean``` will return a boolean value on whether or not any step in the transaction has failed.

```saga.promise(): Promise``` will return a promise which will resolve when all steps are successful, or reject when all steps are completed but one or more failed.

SagaStep class public interface:

```step.success(): void``` will mark this step as successful.

```step.fail(error?: Error): void``` will mark this step as failed.

```step.hasFailed(): boolean``` will return a boolean value on whether or not this step has failed.

```step.hasSucceeded(): boolean``` will return a boolean value on whether or not this step has succeeded.

```onRepair(callback: function): void``` will add a callback listener to the step. The callback is triggered when all the steps in the transaction is completed but some other step in the Saga has failed.

```onFailedRepair(callback: function): void``` will add a callback listener to the step. The callback is triggered whenever the onRepair() callback throws an error.

```getError(): Error``` will return the error provided to the step when fail(error) is called or null.

```getName(): string``` will return the provided name given in saga.begin() or a generated name if none was provided.

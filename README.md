# saga-pattern
saga-pattern testing

# Install
To install the node dependencies run: ```npm install```

# Test
Running ```npm test``` will execute 11 mocha tests.

# Implement
Import the saga class from the saga.js file ```const Saga = require('./saga')```.

Saga class public interface:
Begin() will create a new instance of SagaStep and bind it to this Saga transaction. Every step should represent a atomic mutation in the transaction. Begin can be passed an optional argument object which cn be used to set a custom name to the step.

```saga.begin({name: string}): SagaStep```

onFinallyFailed() will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when the Saga transaction has completed but one or more steps failed.

```saga.onFinallyFailed(callback: function): void```

onFinallySucceeded() will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when the Saga transaction has completed and all steps where successful.

```saga.onFinallySucceeded(callback: function): void```

onStepFailed() will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when any step fail.

```saga.onStepFailed(callback: function): void```

onStepSucceeded() will add a callback listener to the Saga transaction. The callbacks are triggered when any step is completed and successful.

```saga.onStepSucceeded(callback: function): void```

Any callback event listeners should be registred with the four above functions before calling begin().

hasFailed() will return a boolean value on whether or not any step in the transaction has failed

```saga.hasFailed(): boolean```

The following is an example on how to apply the Saga pattern to a simple transaction:

```
const Saga = require('./saga')
const saga = new Saga();
```
